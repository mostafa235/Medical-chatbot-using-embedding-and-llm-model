ðŸš€ Medical Chatbot (PDF-based) - AI-Powered Healthcare Assistant

Iâ€™m excited to share my latest project: a Medical Chatbot that answers health-related questions based on PDF documents! This tool leverages AI and NLP to provide accurate, source-backed medical information, helping users quickly find reliable answers.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:

PDF-based knowledge: Extracts insights from uploaded medical documents.

Context-aware responses: Powered by LangChain and Hugging Face models.

Source citations: Provides references for transparency.

User-friendly interface: Built with Streamlit for seamless interaction.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack:

Python, Streamlit, LangChain, Hugging Face (LLMs), Chroma DB, PyPDF


This project was a deep dive into RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), vector databases, and optimizing LLMs for domain-specific tasks. Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts or collaborate on similar AI/healthtech initiatives!
